<p>Welcome back! Now that the dust has (more or less) settled, I am back on the blog to reflect on my model’s performance on Election Day.</p>
<h1 id="a-tale-of-two-models">A Tale of Two Models</h1>
<p>As a reminder, the following table summarizes the basic characteristics of my two models.</p>

<p>The first three explanatory variables – C, P, and A, in the table above – are exactly the same across both models. Together, they roughly mirror the three facets of Abramowitz’s Time for Change model: a measure of economic performance, a survey of public opinion, and an indicator of incumbency status.</p>
<p>The models are differentiated by the final two components: lagged vote share and state-level polling. My goal was to make the models as similar as possible, so both incorporate a measure of previous year Democratic two-party vote share, but the popular vote model only uses the national result (L), while the electoral college model uses state results (V). S, an all-time state-level polling average, is the only variable with no equivalent in the popular vote regression. Since polls are not – or were not, at the time that I finalized the prediction – available in all states, S also has some internal inconsistencies, as “missing” states were populated by applying their deviation from the national popular vote in 2020 to P, the most recent national polling average from 538.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, my electoral college model hit the mark (see Figure I below, which correctly predicts Trump’s sweep of the battleground states) while my nearly identical popular vote model floundered, predicting a Harris victory that clearly has not come to pass.</p>

<h1 id="assessing-my-popular-vote-model">Assessing My Popular Vote Model</h1>
<p>Let’s start with what went wrong: the popular vote model.</p>
<p>When we zoom out to look at the model’s predictions over multiple election years, the model’s accuracy begins to look more respectable. Figure II shows that the historical elections are well distributed along the fitted line, with 2024 falling roughly in the middle of the pack in terms of accuracy.</p>
<img src="/election-blog/post/2024/11/18/post-election-reflection/index_files/figure-html/print pop_acc_plot-1.png" width="672" />
<p>Admittedly, the data points are few and far between, but based on this visualization, the model does not seem to be getting substantially better – or worse – over time. The model does slightly overestimate Democratic vote share in 2020 and 2024, but I am hesitant to take those two observations as proof of a systematic tendency to underestimate Trump, especially since the model is inclined to overestimate Clinton’s vote share in 2016.</p>
<p>Next, I tweaked the regression formula, one element at a time, with the hope of weeding out any problematic variables. The results of this investigation can be found in the table below.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the adjusted r-squared improvements were minimal. In most cases, dropping or swapping a variable produced a model that explained only about as much, if not less, of the variation in Democratic two-party vote share.</p>
<p>The exceptions to this are the model that dropped ICS and the model that substituted GDP growth in its place. In both cases, I should note, the percentage of variation explained increased by a modest 3 to 4 points, the MSE (mean squared error) and RMSE (root mean squared error) barely moved, and the resulting prediction overestimated Harris more severely than the original model. While I am not convinced that consumer sentiment is the driving factor behind my model’s failure in 2024 specifically, there seems to be reason to be cautious of consumer sentiment’s long-term predictive power, at least when it is serving as the sole economic indicator.</p>
<p>The other standout from this table is the “no polling average” model, which yielded a 2024 national popular vote prediction that was just 0.04 points over Harris’s two-party vote share (though the actual number may shift slightly in the coming days and weeks as the last votes are tallied). This improvement, however, comes at the cost of a lower adjusted r-squared and the highest MSE and RMSE of all seven models – this is perfectly fine if the model’s only purpose is to predict the 2024 results, but it could compromise its ability to generate plausible predictions for future elections.</p>
<p>So far, we have identified two possible weakness areas: polls and consumer sentiment. I will revisit both and offer substantive hypotheses in the final section of this post. For now, we should check in on the electoral college model.</p>
<h1 id="assessing-my-electoral-college-model">Assessing My Electoral College Model</h1>
<p>Predicting a winner in each state is one thing – the real challenge is predicting state-level vote share, and my model had its fair share of mistakes in that respect.</p>
<p>Figure III, below, displays each state’s prediction error. Blue states had predictions that overestimated Harris’s eventual vote share, while red states underestimated her.</p>
<p>The most biased states were New Jersey (-4.7 points) and Illinois (-3.5 points). By contrast, the state most biased in favor of Trump, North Carolina, was much closer to that state’s observed vote share (+1.3 points).</p>

<p>Thank you for joining me this week! This is, unfortunately, the end of the road for these particular predictive models, but I look forward to returning in a few weeks’ time with my final post, which will discuss the election through the lens of Nebraska politics. See you then!</p>
